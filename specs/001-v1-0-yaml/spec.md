## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

A Buddhist practitioner visits the Sutra Guide website to study a specific sutra (e.g., Heart Sutra, Diamond Sutra). They want to:
1. Browse a list of available sutras (1-3 sutras in V1.0)
2. Select a sutra from the list
3. Navigate through chapters of the chosen sutra
4. Read the original text alongside vernacular translation, annotations, and practice insights
5. View related illustrations for better understanding
6. Listen to corresponding podcast episodes for audio learning
7. Adjust the visual theme (light/dark mode) for comfortable reading in different environments

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user arrives at the website homepage, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see a list of 1-3 available sutras with titles and basic information

2. **Given** a user has selected a specific sutra from the list, **When** they view the table of contents, **Then** they can see all chapters of that sutra with clear chapter titles and can click to navigate to any chapter

3. **Given** a user is viewing a chapter, **When** the chapter page loads, **Then** they can see:
   - Original sutra text (classical Chinese)
   - Annotations and commentary
   - Vernacular translation (modern Chinese)
   - Practice insights and guidance
   - Related illustrations (if available)
   - Link to corresponding podcast episode (if available)

4. **Given** a user is reading in bright sunlight, **When** they toggle the theme switch, **Then** the website switches between light mode and dark mode, and the preference is preserved across sessions

5. **Given** a user is on chapter 3 of a sutra, **When** they click on chapter 5 in the table of contents, **Then** they are immediately taken to chapter 5 content without page reload delay

6. **Given** a user clicks on a podcast link in a chapter, **When** the link is activated, **Then** they are taken to the external podcast platform page in a new tab/window

7. **Given** a chapter has a corrupted YAML file, **When** a user tries to view that chapter, **Then** an error message is displayed, the chapter content is hidden, but navigation to other chapters remains functional

8. **Given** a user notices a content error, **When** they access the error reporting feature, **Then** they can click a mailto link or external form link to submit their report

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a chapter YAML file is missing or corrupted? → Display error message, hide chapter, allow browsing other chapters
- What happens when a chapter has no podcast link available? → Clearly indicate podcast is not available
- What happens when a chapter has no illustrations? → Display text content only
- How does the system handle very long chapters (performance)? → Must still meet 500ms chapter navigation target
- What happens when a user accesses a non-existent sutra or chapter? → Display graceful error message
- How does the system handle different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)? → Responsive design (implicit requirement)
- What happens if the user's browser doesn't support theme preference storage? → Default to light mode, allow session-only switching

## Requirements
